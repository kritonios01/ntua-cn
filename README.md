Lab exercises for the Computer Networks course in ECE, NTUA. This 7th semester course is mandatory for anyone who chooses to follow the Telecommunication Systems and Computer Networks flow in the Electrical and Computer Engineering School of NTUA.

The purpose of these exercises is to familiarise with computer network protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, SMTP and many more. For each exercise I used Wireshark to capture and analyse specific packets.
